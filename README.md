Project Name

A US-based housing company named Surprise Housing has decided to enter the Australian market. The company uses data analytics to purchase houses at a price below their actual values and flip them on at a higher price. For the same purpose, the company has collected a data set from the sale of houses in Australia. The data is provided in the CSV file below.

 

The company is looking at prospective properties to buy to enter the market. You are required to build a regression model using regularisation in order to predict the actual value of the prospective properties and decide whether to invest in them or not.

 

The company wants to know:

Which variables are significant in predicting the price of a house, and

How well those variables describe the price of a house.

 

Also, determine the optimal value of lambda for ridge and lasso regression.

General Information
This repo contains a Jupyter note book that contains multilinear regression modeling along with a data set, a data dictionary, and answers to subjective questions related to the linear regression model.

Conclusions
The test R-squared score of 0.8018 is relatively close to the training R-squared score of 0.846. this suggests that your model is not overfitting (performing well on the training set but poorly on new data) and is providing a good balance between fit and generalization.
